How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
-I interpret user needs and implement them into a program using thorough communication with the client then developing user stories with the team using what was learned from the continual communication with the client.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
-I feel the best way to approach developing programs is to try get a comprehensive understanding of what is needed by the client, and then planning out next steps, then continuing to develop incrementally through the steps decided upon previously. Continual communication is a must in development. Scrum agile processes are what I plan to use in future developmental work. User stories, sprint planning and the whole scrum agile method are wonderful tools.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
-Flexibility and understanding are excellent qualities in a team member in software development. There are so many more qualities that would be great to have but I think these are important because with software development you must be adaptable for the method to work well. Things happens, they go wrong and so very often people just change their minds. To be understanding in any situation is a plus. Being a supportive is also important because after all you are part of a team and teams work together towards their goals.
